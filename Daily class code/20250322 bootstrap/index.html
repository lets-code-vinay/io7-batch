        If you're looking for random paragraphs, you've come to the right place.
        When a random word or a random sentence isn't quite enough, the next
        logical step is to find a random paragraph. We created the Random
        Paragraph Generator with you in mind. The process is quite simple.
        Choose the number of random paragraphs you'd like to see and click the
        button. Your chosen number of paragraphs will instantly appear. While it
        may not be obvious to everyone, there are a number of reasons creating
        random paragraphs can be useful. A few examples of how some people use
        this generator are listed in the following paragraphs. Creative Writing
        Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get
        their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no
        idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This
        forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common
        writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of
        a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random
        paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to
        have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No
        matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to
        use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing. Tackle
        Writers' Block A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a
        writer to tackle writers' block. Writing block can often happen due to
        being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to
        complete. By inserting a completely random paragraph from which to
        begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been causing
        the writers' block in the first place. Beginning Writing Routine Another
        productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. One
        way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to try to
        rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose here is
        to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes onto their
        day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their fingers.
        Writing Challenge Another writing challenge can be to take the
        individual sentences in the random paragraph and incorporate a single
        sentence from that into a new paragraph to create a short story. Unlike
        the random sentence generator, the sentences from the random paragraph
        will have some connection to one another so it will be a bit different.
        You also won't know exactly how many sentences will appear in the random
        paragraph.
