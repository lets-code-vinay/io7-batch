      letter-spacing: 5px -- Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent
      way for writers to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the
      day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about
      when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one
      of three common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as
      the first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option is to
      use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third
      option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short
      story. No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is
      forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.
