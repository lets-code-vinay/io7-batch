      <h1>Dead Girl</h1>
      <p>
        <img src="../00 images/images/girl.webp" />
        Outside the funeral home, I heard a boy say that she had fallen off the
        back of her boyfriend’s motorcycle. Broken her neck. She never knew what
        hit her, he said. I was 13. The dead girl had been a junior in high
        school. The line to see her snaked around the building. Boys with long
        hair, wearing ties they’d borrowed from their fathers, and girls with
        thick blue eyeshadow smoked cigarettes in the parking lot. Someone
        passed a bottle of Jack. There were no adults there, just very old kids.
        She almost looked like she was sleeping, except that she was too still.
        There was a puffiness to her face that didn’t seem quite right. They had
        dressed her for the prom; the crinoline sleeves of her gown like poofs
        of pink cotton candy. Some kids prayed, but I couldn’t. I just stared at
        the roses in her corsage.

    <div class="division" id="magic">
      <h1>Magic Show</h1>

        “How’d he get in there?” said Amy, peering into the opening in the
        basement wall with her hands cupped around her eyes. “Got me,” I said,
        taking a look. Barney, our 18-pound Maine Coon, peered up at me with his
        yellow eyes. The cat had squeezed his massive frame through an opening
        in the wall that an animal half his size would have had trouble with. He
        was trapped. “What are we going to do?” said Amy. “We can’t just leave
        him there.” A metallic aroma, the scent of panic, perfumed the damp
        cellar air. She was right. We couldn’t leave him. But we wouldn’t get
        him out without tearing down the wall, and we were only summer tenants.
        The cat let out a mournful meow. “Barney’s going to die!” Amy cried. So,
        I brushed the tears away from her little cheeks and grabbed the hammer
        from the toolbox.
