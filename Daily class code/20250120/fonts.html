      Since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see, they must have
      been formed quite recently, that is, geologically speaking. What can
      explain these striations and their common orientation? Did you ever hear
      about the Great Ice Age or the Pleistocene Epoch? Less than one million
      years ago, in fact, some 12,000 years ago, an ice sheet many thousands of
      feet thick rode over Burke Mountain in a southeastward direction. The many
      boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the
      rocks over which they rode. The scratches or striations seen in the park
      rocks were caused by these attached boulders. The ice sheet also plucked
      and rounded Burke Mountain into the shape it possesses today.
