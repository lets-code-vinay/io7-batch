## History of ReactJS?

## Feature of ReactJS

1. **Component Based** :
   - UI is broken into reusable components (e.g., buttons, forms, navbars).
   - Each component manages its own state and logic.
2. **JSX (JavaScript XML):**
   - React uses JSX, a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript

```js
const Greeting = () => <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

3. **Virtual DOM** :

   - React creates a virtual version of the browser DOM.
   - When data changes, React updates only the parts of the DOM that changedâ€”this makes it very fast.

4. **Unidirectional Data Flow** :

   - Data flows from parent to child components via props (properties).

   - Components can manage internal state using `useState` and similar hooks.

5. **Hooks** :

   - Hooks like useState and useEffect let you manage state and side effects in functional components.

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
