      Outside the <b>funeral home</b>, I heard <strong>a boy</strong> say that
      she had fallen off the back of her <i><b>boyfriend’s</b> motorcycle</i>.
      Broken her neck. She never knew what hit her, he said.
      <strong><em>I was 13.</em></strong> The <del>dead</del>
      <ins>passed</ins> girl had been a junior in high school.
      <br />
      <br />
      The line to see her
      <small><strong>snaked around the building</strong></small
      >. Boys with <big>long hair</big>, wearing ties they’d borrowed from their
      fathers, and girls with thick
      <mark>blue eyeshadow smoked cigarettes</mark> in the parking lot. Someone
      passed a bottle of Jack. There were no adults there, just very old kids.

      <br />She almost looked like she was <sup>sleeping</sup>, except that she
      was too still. There was a puffiness to her face that didn’t seem
      <sub>quite</sub>
      right. They had dressed her for the prom; the

      of her gown like poofs of pink cotton candy. Some kids prayed, but I
