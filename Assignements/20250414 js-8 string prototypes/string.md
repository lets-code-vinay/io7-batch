### ðŸ”¹ Bonus Assignments (String Prototype Combinations)

#### 1. Trim, Slice, and Pad Together

Create a function that:

- Takes a string input
- Trims it from both ends
- Slices the first 8 characters
- Pads the result from the end to make it 12 characters long using `#`

#### 2. Substring and PadStart

Create a function that:

- Takes a name string
- Extracts a substring from index 1 to 4
- Pads the start of this substring with `0` until the total length becomes 8

#### 3. Trim, Substring, and PadEnd

Create a function that:

- Accepts a string with extra spaces
- Trims it
- Gets a substring from index 2 to 6
- Pads the result with `*` at the end so it's 10 characters long

#### 4. Slice Negative and PadStart

Create a function that:

- Takes a string input
- Uses `.slice(-5)` to extract the last 5 characters
- Pads the start with `!` to make the result 10 characters long

#### 5. Chained Cleanup and Substring Extraction

Create a function that:

- Accepts a string
- Trims it
- Converts it to uppercase
- Extracts the first 6 characters using `.substring()`
